## Epoch 4 - April 2024

This is the most challenging and the fun part where AI algorithms are listed by integrating OpenCog AI platform. We want to make sure that it is fully tested before it is launched live, hence it comes as the last epoch. If trials shows results, this epoch will be pushed along with epoch 2 or 3.
