## What

botic-chain is a decentralized platform for connecting autonomous robots.

## Why

Every industry is trying to integrate robotics one way or another. Autonomous Robots market is valued at $1.9B in 2019 by a market research and it is predicted to grow at a rate of 29% AGR. Most of these autonomous robots are used for industrial applications. The more accessible version of these robots are drones which has a huge commercial market. In United States alone, there were 1.7 million drones registered. These operate on an individual network only for specific purposes. There is currently no common platform for all these robots and drones to connect and collaborate.

This was analogous to the various financial services which was offered by various banks and financial organizations. The recent advent of decentralized finance popularly called as **DeFi** which was enabled by blockchain technologies such as smart contracts and trustless shared ledgers, enabled various services to be integrated with each other on a common platform.
