# How botic-chain - v1 works

## Robot Listing

This is a use case for the first version of botic-chain app. It will allow the drone owners to list their drones on the market. Once the information is verified and access is established, the drone is listed for rent on the botic-chain app. On the backend, a smart contract is created for each robot which is connected to the ROS and then deployed on to the blockchain network.

## Robot Deployment

Any registered user with a verified credential, will see the drone listed and they can deploy the drone directly from the platform. This is achieved through connection of DApp with a smart contract.
