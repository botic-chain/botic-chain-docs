## Pradeep Kumar Prakasam

Hi, I'm Pradeep, a passionate Blockchain developer and a R&D engineer from Toronto. My passion for innovation led me to learn Blockchain and I forked my career into Blockchain Development through a course at George Brown College, Toronto. I am also an active volunteer at Bitcoin Bay maintaining the OPTN wallet. When I am not working, I like to explore new and exciting stuff and participate in interesting Hackathons.

Prior to this fork, I was an avid and accomplished researcher in the field of Smart Manufacturing. I have a PhD from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and have worked with Rolls-Royce - Singapore, Schlumberger - Abu Dhabi and IIT-Madras, India.

With botic-chain I am merging the forks combining my **blockchain** experience with my previous experience in **robotics** and R&D.
